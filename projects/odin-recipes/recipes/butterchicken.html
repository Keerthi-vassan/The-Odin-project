        <p>This butter chicken recipe, or chicken makhani, is one of my favorite Indian dishes. It features a full-flavored sauce that complements the chicken well. It can be made as mild or spicy as you wish by adjusting the cayenne. Serve with basmati rice and naan bread.</p>

        <li>1 cup tomato puree</li>
        <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
        <li>¼ cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>

          1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size pieces
        </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>

    </div>

    <div class="steps">
      <p>
        <h4>step 1</h4>
        Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Sauté
        shallot and onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>step 2</h4>
        Stir in butter, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon garam
        masala, chili powder, cumin, and bay leaf. Cook and stir for 1 minute.
        Add tomato sauce, and cook for 2 minutes, continuing to frequently stir.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>step 3</h4>
        Stir in half-and-half and yogurt. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10
        minutes, frequently stirring. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from
        heat and set aside.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>step 4</h4>
        Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over medium
        heat. Cook chicken until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>step 5</h4>
        Reduce heat, and season with remaining 1 teaspoon garam masala and
        cayenne. Stir in a few spoonfuls of sauce, and simmer until liquid has
        reduced, and chicken is no longer pink. Add cooked chicken into sauce
        and stir together.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>step 6</h4>
        Dissolve cornstarch into water, then mix into the sauce. Cook for 5 to
        10 minutes, or until thickened.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>step 7</h4>
        Serve over rice with naan.</p>
